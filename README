This is a very basic command line JMX Client Written in Jython.
It takes two arguments, host and port for making a remote JMX connection and pulling memory statistics from a JVM.
I plan on extending the client to be robust, and perhaps build a Web interface on the engine for trending.

Any questions should be directed to matthew@thebitsource.com.
